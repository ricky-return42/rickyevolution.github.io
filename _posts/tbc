According to ... data scientist is one of the sexiest jobs in the coming decades. More and more poeple around the world would like to enter the field. Students are luckier now that they can pick data science as their degree to pursue. However for the rest of us who have already graduated or are too young to be admitted at the moment, there seems to be no clear way of how to get ourselves started. 

## Fear Not!

This new series of blog posts are written to provide a guide to the ones who are determined. The aim of this all new series is to give you the taste of what a data scientist might do in their work and hopefully you can take away with you some skills and concepts that would help you along the way.

Being data scientists, we work with data a lot (surprisingly)! In this introduction we will be using the Titanic dataset which you can find in <a href=''>Kaggle</a>. This is one of the best data sets around for beginners as it allows data scientists to practise various skills to different depths! Thanks to the popularity of the data set there are many resources out on the web providing how we can analyse it. For example Kaggle itself has a series of <a href=''>tutorials</a> to get you started! You might say:

##So let's dive in and build a model!

Not so quick my friend. Amongst data scientist there is a very popular saying "Garbage in..." and guess what comes out! Therefore the first step would be to obtain and "prettify" the data so our models would be accurate and robust.

## Alright then let's get the data and crack on!

Patience is
